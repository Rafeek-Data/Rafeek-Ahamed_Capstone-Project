<h1 align="center">Electronics Retail Sales Dataset</h1>

This repository contains a transactional dataset capturing retail sales performance for consumer electronics products throughout the first half of **2026**. The data includes granular details on order parameters, product categories, geographic regions, salesperson mapping, and promotional discounts.

It serves as an excellent resource for exploratory data analysis (EDA), sales performance forecasting, regional market analysis, and missing data imputation practice.

1.	Regional Sales Performance & Geographic Market Analysis
	>> Evaluate total revenue, transaction volume, and average order value across different geographic regions (Region) to identify high-performing markets and underperforming zones.
2.	Impact of Discount Strategies on Net Revenue and Volume
	>> Investigate the relationship between Discount percentages and the resulting Quantity sold versus total net Sales to determine whether discounting successfully stimulates demand or negatively impacts revenue margins.
3.	Product Demand and Revenue Concentration Analysis
	>> Identify which specific Product lines dominate total revenue generation and sales volume to pinpoint core revenue drivers versus low-performing inventory
4.	Salesperson Productivity and Performance Benchmarking
	>> Assess individual sales representatives (Salesperson) based on total sales generated, transaction frequency, and average order size to establish performance benchmarks
5.	Temporal Sales Trends and Demand Seasonality
	>> Examine periodic and monthly variations in sales transactions over time (Date) to detect peak purchasing windows and seasonal demand fluctuations.

## 🗂️ Data Dictionary

The dataset consists of the following 10 features:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description | Example Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Order_ID** | String | A unique alphanumeric identifier for each transaction. | `ORD078` |
| **Date** | Date | The transaction date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. | `2026-04-09` |
| **Product** | String | The name of the electronic item sold. | `Laptop`, `Mouse`, `Webcam` |

## 🔍 Data Quality & Cleaning Notes

If you are using this dataset for data cleaning projects, please note that it intentionally contains realistic real-world data anomalies:
* **Missing Values (NaNs):** Features like `Region`, `Salesperson`, `Unit_Price`, `Discount`, and `Sales` contain scattered missing fields (e.g., missing revenue values or unattributed regional boundaries).
* **Calculated Columns:** The `Sales` column follows the general formula:  
  \[\text{Sales} = (\text{Quantity} \times \text{Unit\_Price}) \times (1 - \text{Discount})\]
  This relationship can be exploited to programmatically restore missing metrics.
* **Empty Rows:** The raw structure contains blank structural divider rows (`,,,,,,,,,`) that should be filtered out during preprocessing.

## 🛠️ Usage Example (Python & Pandas)

Get started analyzing this dataset quickly using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset and drop completely empty structural lines
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv').dropna(how='all')

# Convert date column to datetime object
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Quick view of total sales revenue by product
revenue_by_product = df.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
print("Revenue by Product:\n", revenue_by_product)
